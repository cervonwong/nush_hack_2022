#LiveLaughLogic

## What is this ðŸ¤”
This is an education app to allow teenagers like ourselves to learn more about the logic gates and its notations. Users can construct circuits using the app's drag-and-drop interface.

## Motivation ðŸ’ª
Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital electronics. They can be found in our daily appliances such as our thermostats and phones, and can also be found in life-saving hospital appliances and mission-critical spaceship supercomputers.

To motivate and inspire the next-generation of engineers, we have decided to design and develop a gamified experience that will teach them about the fundamental concepts in electrical and computer engineering â€” logic gates!

## How it works âš’

We used the flutter framework with dart and it runs on windows and any web browser on any device. (except mobile) To test the circuits we used a recursive way to test whether a given circuit worked with gates and checked whether it returned the correct outputs as the boolean algebra expression.

## Accomplishments
