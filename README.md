# LiveLaughLogic

## What is this ðŸ¤”
It is an interactive game with a series of puzzles. The prompt is a boolean algebra expression and the programmer must find out where to put the gates such that the correct combinatorial circuit is made using the drag-and-drop interface.

## Motivation ðŸ’ª
Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital electronics. They can be found in our daily appliances such as our thermostats and phones, and can also be found in life-saving hospital appliances and mission-critical spaceship supercomputers.

To motivate and inspire the next generation of engineers, we designed and developped a gamified experience that will teach them about the fundamental concepts in electrical and computer engineering â€” logic gates!

## How we built it âš’
 - In order to reach the greatest number of users, we build this app with Flutter, which allows it to be played on any desktop web browser and even in Windows. 
 - We built a circuit verifier and a boolean expression parser in Dart to allow users to experiment with different circuit combinations.
 - We used Firebase to host the website on [nush-hack-2022.web.app](https://nush-hack-2022.web.app/#/) and to manage routing and persistence.
